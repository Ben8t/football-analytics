# FootScrapeViz repository

This repository consist of data-visualization and some R scripts on football data.
Most of these works are developed with R, especially : 

* dplyr
* ggplot2
* rvest

and all the awesome tidyverse...

## More developed works

### Maps

It's better to see directly [details here](https://github.com/DevBen8/FootScrapeViz/tree/master/Maps). Inspired by [@11tegen11](https://twitter.com/11tegen11) on Twitter.

While data is the main problem for that kind of plot, I found that WhoScored let they data in their javascript. I dev a crawler to get them easly and save them into a json file.
